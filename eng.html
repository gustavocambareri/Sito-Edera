      <h1 id="targetTitolo">0. Manifesto Organico</h1>
      <p><span class="hover-effect">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The organic manifesto, like a living creature,
        mutates and regenerates its own form, solidifying
        its being and at the same time reshaping its
        thinking, constantly questioning itself in order to
        shatter any <i>Ideological veil</i>.</span></p>
        <h1 id="targetTitolo">1. Why Edera</h1>
        <p><span class="hover-effect">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As ivy, which inspired our name, Edera, aims
            at permeating through the city’s wefts, creating
            a new environment in the reality of Milan and
            beyond, formed by people determined to build an
            elastic and stimulating context from an artistic,
            personal, cultural and social point of view.
            <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All this is only feasible through constant
            research and direct involvement of people with
            different kinds of abilities, sharing among all the
            concrete possibilities and space to fully express
            their inspiration.
            <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Edera’s goal is, therefore, to generate a
            human substrate that is as homogeneous in
            intentions as multifaceted in socio-cultural
            intersectionality.</span></p>
          <h1 id="targetTitolo">2. Morphic Resonance</h1>
          <p><span class="hover-effect">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Edera Collective believes in the existence of
            a shared memory, characterized by the stillness of
            the past, present, and future.
            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tapping philosophically into Rupert
            Sheldrake’s Morphic Resonance theory, Edera
            Collective believes that investigating the eternal
            bond between past and future dimensions is
            fundamental for establishing a direct connection
            with who will replace us in the future, looking out
            to what the past gave us and learning from it.</span></p>
      <h1 id="targetTitolo">3. Natural Dualism</h1>
      <p><span class="hover-effect">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Edera Collective embraces the dualistic
        conception of Nature conceived in its physical
        dimension as the foundation of existence and
        the living Principle operating and generating
        all things, and in its ideological facet, in which
        Nature propels Being in a process of <i>Total Ethical
          Mimesis</i>.</span></p>
        <h1 id="targetTitolo">4. Unavoidability and Coexistence.</h1>
        <p><span class="hover-effect">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In total affinity with the principles featured
            in the Manifesto of Rural Futurism, Edera deems
            it necessary to raise popular awareness regarding
            the conflicting areas of today’s dialectical
            relationship between society and the natural
            world.
            <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The key point of reflection is the
            internalization of these conflicting dimensions,
            to carry out a real process of eco-cultural
            revaluation of space, polarizing social
            consciousness toward a dimension of Coexistence.</span></p>
          <h1 id="targetTitolo">5. Natural Suprematism</h1>
          <p><span class="hover-effect">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By Natural Suprematism Edera means the
            supremacy of pure sensibility in the multimedia
            arts in relation to Nature. Natural phenomena
            acquire meaning within themselves at the moment
            they are involved in the universal and timeless
            process of Morphic Resonance.
            <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the dialectic of Natural Suprematism the
            concretization of the sensibility of consciousness
            occurs through a representation that, in the
            creative path, loses its purely abstract and
            figurative dimension, thus rediscovering its
            objective essence.</span></p>
            <h1 id="targetTitolo">6. Sound</h1>
            <p><span class="hover-effect">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sound allows us to contribute, through
                a cathartic and emotional process, to the
                internalization of the representative dimensions of
                our investigation, giving a voice to the seemingly
                silent world that is the environments in which we
                move.
                <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moreover, Edera believes that Sound
                represents one of the real cultural and social
                aggregators, identifying it as a possible joining link
                between our inner self and the external world of
                the social community.</span></p>
              <h1 id="targetTitolo">7. Light</h1>
              <p><span class="hover-effect">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Light, the tangible substance that with its
                movement permeates everything and composes
                the Cosmos framework, is one of the central
                elements of Edera Collective.
                <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Light beams, capable of striking directly
                and instinctively, cleave darkness and allow
                the definitive liberation from the <i>“Ricatto del
                  Buio”</i>: a condition in which every abandoned and
                unnecessary space it’s forced to perish in darkness
                and stasis.</span></p>
                <h1 id="targetTitolo">8. Speculative Fantasy</h1>
                <p><span class="hover-effect">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Edera embraces the use of <i>Speculative
                  Fantasy</i> as a transcendent research engine,
                    which is the necessary first step in the process of
                    translating abstractions of Being into concrete
                    form.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The necessary condition to prevent this
                    process from involuting into a sterile situationist
                    rhetoric is the implication of critical and futuristic
                    thinking.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Speculation, therefore prediction; prediction,
                    therefore Action.</span></p>
                  <h1 id="targetTitolo">9. Web Trip</h1>
                  <p><span class="hover-effect">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In an age of constant technological
                    expansion, Edera envisions the Digital as
                    an extension of Being and as a virtuous tool
                    apt for the growth of social welfare. Edera
                    detaches itself from a prejudicial rejection of
                    technological progress, while instead probing the
                    social potential for the expansion of <i>Connective
                      Intelligence</i> inherent in the Asimov-ian Virtual
                    Paraverse.</span></p>
                    <h1 id="targetTitolo">10. Free and accessible cultural fruition</h1>
                    <p><span class="hover-effect">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Edera believes that free and egalitarian
                        access to culture is of vital importance,
                        condemning all kinds of economic speculation,
                        both in the propagative and receiving dimensions.
                        <br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, Edera’s work turns to promoting
                        alternative accesses of its enjoyment in a
                        constructive way, acknowledging in them a close
                        link between participation in cultural events and
                        the growth of a person’s state of well-being and
                        health.</span></p>
                      <h1 id="targetTitolo">11. Cathartic Dance</h1>
                      <p><span class="hover-effect">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Picking up on Paolo Pecere’s reflection
                        regarding Cathartic Dance, understood as a ritual
                        space and growth of social well-being, Edera
                        believes it is necessary to preserve an indissoluble
                        link between the hedonistic liberation of dance
                        and the cultural importance of events or moments
                        of gathering and sharing.
                        <br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ecstasy of Dance, for this reason, must
                        turn its gaze toward a positive socio-cultural
                        progression and not “marginalize” itself in a
                        bubble of blind celebration and self-induced
                        exclusion.</span></p>
                        <h1 id="targetTitolo">12. Bacchanalia</h1>
                        <p><span class="hover-effect">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The capitalist conception of social
                            functionality in recent years has shaped in
                            common thinking a vision whereby events of
                            aggregation and cultural enjoyment seem to be
                            entirely separated from the progress of society
                            and its socio-economic facets.
                            <br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Edera rejects this vision entirely and believes
                            it is necessary to subvert it through participatory
                            awareness and informative actions, recognizing
                            community union as a virtuous political tool.</span></p>
                          <h1 id="targetTitolo">13. Necessary Battles</h1>
                          <p><span class="hover-effect">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Edera supports in both symbolism and
                            practical action the pursuit and expansion of
                            socio-cultural well-being and safeness, advancing
                            the ideals of anti-fascism, anti-racism and anti-
                            sexism.
                            <br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In order to counter the feelings of hatred and
                            discrimination that still infect the world we live in
                            under various forms, Edera believes it is necessary
                            to carry on a determined and constant battle, both
                            in one’s own microcosm as well as in the support of
                            other realities engaged on the same front.</span></p>
                            <h1 id="targetTitolo">14. Safe Wellness</h1>
                            <p><span class="hover-effect">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The stigmatization of hedonistic practices no
                                longer has any reason to exist and to condition our
                                expressive pattern: therefore, spaces are needed
                                to enjoy, to express one’s being consciously and to
                                transcend the individuality of the body’s threshold,
                                thus cultivating the duality of joy and revolution
                                as the guiding principle of everyday life.

                                and mental well-being of the community, thus
                                becoming a vehicle for healing and community
